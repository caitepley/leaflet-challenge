# leaflet-challenge
The purpose of this challenge is to plot earthquake data from the United States Geological Survey on top of map data using JavaScript and Leaflet. Each point plotted on the map represents an earthquake, with the size of the marker denoting the magnitude of the quake and the color of the marker denoting the depth at which the quake occured. 

## To Run:
Live server needs to be installed on the local machine. The .html file called 'index.html' can be opened in the live server to show the map with the markers.
